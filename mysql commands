# TO FIX PROBLEM CONNECTING

"""thanks for the answer! But i found it! if anybody encounters the same error i had, to solve that problem, you need to modify the /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf file since today when you install mysql, it install mariadb instead and i guess the config files are different. then once you get into 50-server.cnf you just need to comment "bind-address = 127.0.0.1" and it will now listen to other IPs requests."""

# to restart service
sudo service mysql restart

# Log in
sudo mysql -u root -p
sudo mysql -u scbot -p


# view all users
select * from mysql.user

or simpler

select host, user, password from mysql.user;

#create database
CREATE DATABASE exampledb;

USE scratchdb;


# create user
CREATE USER 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

# grant priveges
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON exampledb.* TO 'username'@'localhost';
change localhost to allow access from any ip

#GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON scratchdb.* TO 'scratchbot'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'mysqlpassword';

#must do this afterwards
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
